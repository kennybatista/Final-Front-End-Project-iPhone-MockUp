### Story

On the last week of my course, my Front-End Web Development teacher was going around asking students what they wanted to build for their final projects. The majority of them stated that they wanted to build a portfolio or a buy and sell site. I did not want to build something that was already built or that everyone was doing, so when the teacher sat next to me and asked me what I wanted to do I told her that I wanted to emulate Apple's iOS using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. She laughed and said that I didn't have enough skills yet and that I only had four days to work on this. That day I went home with a growth and determined mindset, I wasn't going go to sleep until I was done building my emulated iOS. 

I started working non-stop and didn't sleep for three days straight, I kept myself up by drinking cans of Red-Bull every time I felt sleepy. I finished building the project and when class started showed her, I saw her eyes open up immensely as she said "WOW, every semester there's that one student that blows my mind, and this time it's you!". The gratification after building this project and surprising her motivated me to work hard towards success, I learned to love to blow peoples mind after proving them wrong.
